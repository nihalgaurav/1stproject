       In late-2000, a young boy in Ahmedabad called Govind dreamt of having a business. To accomodate his friends Ish and Omi�s passion, they open a cricket shop.

Will they make it? Can an individual�s dreams overcome the nightmares offered by real life? Can we succeed despite a few mistakes?

       Five Point Someone is a story about three friends in IIT who are unable
       to cope.
        Three hostelmates � Alok, Hari and Ryan get off to a bad start in IIT �
        they screw up the first class quiz. And while they try to make amends,
        things only get worse.They have a five-point-something GPA out of ten,
        ranking near the end of their class. This GPA is a tattoo that will
        remain with them, and come in the way of anything else that matters �
        their friendship, their future, their love life.
        While the world expects
        IITians to conquer the world, these guys are struggling to survive.
        Will they make it? Do under performers have a right to live? Can they
        show that they are not just a five-point-somebody but a
        five-point-someone?

      Once upon a time, in small-town India, there lived two intelligent boys.
      One wanted to use his intelligence to make money.
      One wanted to use his intelligence to create a revolution.
      The problem was, they both loved the same girl.
      Welcome to Revolution 2020. A story about childhood friends Gopal,
      Raghav and Aarti who struggle to find success and love in Varanasi.
      However,
      it isn�t easy to achieve this in an unfair society that rewards the
      corrupt. As Gopal gives in to the system, and Raghav fights it,
      who will win?

       Hi, I�m Radhika Mehta and I�m getting married this week.
       I work at Goldman Sachs, an investment bank. Thank you for reading my
       story. However, let me warn you. You may not like much.
       One, I make a lot of money.
       Two, I have an opinion on everything.
       Three, I have had a boyfriend before. OK, maybe two.
       Now if I were a guy, you�d be cool with it. Since I am a girl,
       these things don�t make me likeable, do they?
